# FisherAlert

Hi! This is an app to help fishermen keep track of their positions and making sure that they don't travel farther than 12 nautical miles from the shore.

The farthest distance from the shore at which fishermen can be contacted by authorities is 12 nautical miles. If they are notified that they are sailing beyond the reachable limit, they can corect course and stay within reach of radio contact
